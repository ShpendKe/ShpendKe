# Starting My Blog Journey

I’ve tried this before.  
Starting a blog. Writing something.  

And every time, I failed.  

Not because of the tools. I know how to set up a blog.  
I failed because I wasn’t sure what to say.  

Every topic I thought about… I told myself:  
- *"Someone already wrote about this. It’s all out there on the internet."*  
- *"Does any of this add value in the time of AI?"*  

So I stopped. Again and again.

## Here’s the truth

Here’s the truth:  
I’m still not sure if this will change.  

But I’m shifting my perspective.  

It doesn’t matter if the knowledge already exists.  
What matters is **my experience**.  
My lessons. My mistakes. My wins.  

This blog isn’t about filling the internet with more information.  
It’s about me—writing things down so I don’t lose them.  

## The Questions I Still Have

- Which language should I use? German or English?  
- How should I write? Short and raw? Or polished and professional?  
- How much time should/can I spend for blogging?

I don’t have the answers (yet).  

## But here’s what I know

But here’s what I know:  

I’m not writing for an audience anymore.  
I’m writing for myself.  

To capture what I’ve learned.  
To remind myself how I got here.  

I prefer giving talks over writing.  
When I speak, I can show things. I can feel the reaction.  

So maybe this blog won’t just be words.  
Maybe it will become something more—talks, videos, demos.  
We’ll see.  

**This is the start.  
Not perfect. Not complete.  
But real.**
