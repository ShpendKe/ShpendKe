# Speech at Basta Fall 2022: How to establish monitoring in your agile Team

Monitoring is the best way to give team members a good night's sleep. No one wants to be woken up in the morning by a call from an angry supervisor: "The system is not working; fix it now!". Granted, monitoring doesn't just help restful sleep but relatively quick feedback from real users. After all, we all strive for feedback in agile teams. With monitoring, real and fast feedback becomes possible, where tests only allow it with a lot of effort or are not feasible at all.

But how can agile teams establish monitoring in their daily routine? How do you get the metrics for monitoring? Who is responsible for monitoring, and when is monitoring the right tool?

In this talk, I will show by example the path to continuous and proactive monitoring in agile teams and where they should pay attention to. For this purpose, the possibilities of Azure Monitoring are used, and Infrastructure as Code is used to set up the selected monitoring solution.
