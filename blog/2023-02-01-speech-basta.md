# Speech at Basta Spring 2023: Infrastructure as Code or Click, click, bang - Choose your way

You're working on an ongoing project, but you're tired of manually applying any infrastructure changes to all environments. Not to mention documenting the changes. Ideally, the team would focus on delivering features.
Regardless of the project's progress, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can be used to make that happen. However, it is not easy to get started, and you quickly fall into "Infrastructure by clicking". What are the risks of this approach, and why is it worthwhile to rely on IaC? What tools are available, and which is suitable for your team?
This talk will demonstrate how you can integrate Azure Bicep into your CI/CD pipeline using examples and best practices. This way, your team quickly delivers new features to the customer.
