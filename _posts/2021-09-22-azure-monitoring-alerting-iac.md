This post is to show Markdown syntax rendering on [**Chirpy**](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/fork), you can also use it as an example of writing. Now, let's start looking at text and typography.

# Why do we need monitoring?
Often monitoring is seen as optional. But without monitoring you will not get real feedback.
Urs Enzler demonstrates in his [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-35GpOJnjmM) 
 - Real feedback
 - We get feedback over the whole product/feature development. 
 -
- What to monitor?
  - Incident
  - Security
  - Availability
  - Performance
  - Costs

- What does Azure offer? (Intro Azure Monitor)
  -

- Pls tell me if something is wrong with alerts

- What should we do when alerting and who is responsible?

- Don't get your hand dirty
  - Examples

## Paragraph

I wandered lonely as a cloud

That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

When all at once I saw a crowd,

A host, of golden daffodils;

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

## Mermaid SVG

```mermaid
 gantt
  title  Adding GANTT diagram functionality to mermaid
  apple :a, 2017-07-20, 1w
  banana :crit, b, 2017-07-23, 1d

```


## Mathematics

The mathematics powered by [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/):

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
